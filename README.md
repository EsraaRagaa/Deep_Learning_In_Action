# Deep_Learning_In_Action
A Current List of The Deep Learning Projects(mainly in Computer vision, Natural Language Processing)

For every porject, I will provide the source code and the paper

##Deep Learning Framework

Now there are many frameworks, such as Caffe,Mxnet,Tensorflow,Theano.

I highly recommend Mxnet and Caffe for CV project, Tensorflow for NLP project.
